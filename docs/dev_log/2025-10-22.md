# Development Log â€“ 2025-10-22

## [2025-10-22] [Copilot] - Documentation Review & Accuracy Update

**Feature/Module:** Repository Documentation (README, USER_GUIDE, DEVELOPER_GUIDE, pyproject.toml)  
**Change:** Comprehensive documentation review and accuracy corrections across all technical files  
**Reason:** Documentation was outdated with references to old file structures, missing dependencies, and placeholder values  
**Impact:** Documentation now accurately reflects current codebase, improves onboarding, and ensures installation instructions work correctly

---

### Session Context

- **Project:** DocTR Process (OCR pipeline for truck ticket extraction)
- **Task:** Review and update all documentation for accuracy
- **Stack:** Python 3.10+, python-doctr[torch], PyMuPDF, Tesseract, Poppler
- **Architecture:** Modular structure under `src/doctr_process/` with pipeline_v2, logging_setup, post_ocr_corrections
- **Design Decisions:**
  - Aligned pyproject.toml with requirements.txt dependencies
  - Modernized DEVELOPER_GUIDE to reflect current architecture (pipeline_v2, not legacy)
  - Completely rewrote USER_GUIDE with current CLI commands and features
  - Fixed repository URLs and placeholder values
- **TODOs:** 
  - [ ] Consider adding integration tests documentation
  - [ ] Document utils/ OCR scripts (ocr_embed_pdf.py, batch files)
  - [ ] Add architecture diagrams to DEVELOPER_GUIDE

---

### Changes Made

#### 1. README.md
**Changed:**
- Fixed placeholder `USERNAME` â†’ `batkins33` in CI badge
- Updated repository URL to `https://github.com/batkins33/DocTR_Process.git`
- Improved installation instructions with both pip and editable install options
- Added requirements.txt installation method alongside pyproject.toml

**Impact:** New developers can now clone and install correctly without guessing placeholder values

#### 2. pyproject.toml
**Changed:**
- Added missing core dependency: `python-doctr[torch]`
- Added missing optional dependencies: `easyocr`, `requests`
- Synchronized with `requirements.txt` to prevent import errors

**Impact:** `pip install -e .` now installs all required dependencies correctly

**Before:**
```toml
dependencies = [
    "python-dotenv>=1.0",
    "pydantic>=2,<3",
    # ... missing python-doctr
]
```

**After:**
```toml
dependencies = [
    "python-doctr[torch]",
    "python-dotenv>=1.0",
    "pydantic>=2,<3",
    # ... complete list
    "easyocr",
    "requests",
]
```

#### 3. DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md
**Changed:**
- Complete architecture overhaul to reflect current structure
- Updated code structure documentation with actual module organization
- Documented current pipeline (pipeline_v2 preferred over legacy pipeline.py)
- Added comprehensive testing section with pytest examples
- Documented logging_setup.py queue-based architecture
- Added post_ocr_corrections.py documentation
- Removed references to outdated files (doctr_ocr_to_csv.py, old module names)
- Added development workflow and code style guidelines
- Documented angle_predictor fallback mechanism to Tesseract OSD

**Impact:** Developers now see accurate technical documentation matching the actual codebase

**Key Additions:**
- Testing section with `pytest` and `run_tests.py` usage
- Performance considerations and optimization tips
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Contributing guidelines and workflow

#### 4. USER_GUIDE.md
**Changed:**
- Complete rewrite from outdated workflow to current CLI/GUI interface
- Updated all command examples to use `doctr-process` and `doctr-gui` entry points
- Documented all CLI flags (--corrections-file, --dict-vendors, --fuzzy matching, etc.)
- Added comprehensive configuration file documentation
- Documented post-OCR corrections feature with examples
- Added detailed output structure explanation
- Created troubleshooting section with practical solutions
- Added best practices section
- Included FAQ section
- Documented SharePoint integration

**Impact:** End users can now successfully install, configure, and use the application with current commands

**Before:** References to `doctr_ocr_to_csv.py` and `[F]ile or [D]irectory` prompts  
**After:** Modern CLI interface with `doctr-process --input samples --output outputs --no-gui`

---

### ðŸ§  Human Summary (Old vs New)

**Old State:**
- README had placeholder `USERNAME` in CI badge
- pyproject.toml missing critical dependency `python-doctr[torch]`
- DEVELOPER_GUIDE referenced outdated file structure and non-existent modules
- USER_GUIDE described obsolete command-line interface and workflows
- No documentation of post-OCR corrections feature or fuzzy matching

**New State:**
- All documentation accurately reflects the current codebase
- Installation instructions work correctly with complete dependencies
- Developer guide shows actual module structure (pipeline_v2, logging_setup, post_ocr_corrections)
- User guide documents current CLI commands (doctr-process, doctr-gui)
- Comprehensive documentation of post-OCR corrections and advanced features
- Troubleshooting sections address common real-world issues
- Best practices and FAQ sections improve user experience

**Impact:**
- New developers can onboard successfully using accurate technical docs
- Users can install and run the application following current instructions
- Documentation serves as reliable reference instead of causing confusion
- Reduced friction for contributors with clear guidelines and examples

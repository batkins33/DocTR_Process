"Title,Body,Labels,Milestone"
"Phase 0: Environment & Config Stabilization,""Goal: lock env, centralize config, reproducible runs.\nTasks: Pin deps; add .env support; add module entrypoint; structured logs with run_id.\nDoD: Fresh clone -> install -> python -m doctr_process runs; logs under outputs/logs."",enhancement;roadmap,""Sprint 1"""
"Phase 1: Repo & Module Cleanup,""Goal: clear package areas and enforce lint/types.\nTasks: move gui to ui/; create extract/ and io/; add ruff/black/mypy; fix imports; update tests.\nDoD: ruff/black clean; pytest green; README updated."",enhancement;roadmap,""Sprint 1"""
"Phase 2: Image Pre-processing Module,""Goal: configurable preproc (grayscale, adaptive threshold, denoise, deskew, optional perspective).\nTasks: ocr/preprocess.py; YAML toggles; integrate before OCR; golden tests.\nDoD: measurable OCR lift on sample; toggles work."",enhancement;roadmap,""Sprint 1"""
"Phase 3: OCR Engine Layer Hardening,""Goal: parameterize engines and add OCR cache.\nTasks: expose Tesseract/Doctr/EasyOCR params; per-page cache; unify orientation.\nDoD: swap engines via YAML; reruns faster with cache."",enhancement;roadmap,""Sprint 2"""
"Phase 4: Data Extraction v1 (Positional + Fuzzy),""Goal: reduce regex brittleness.\nTasks: extract/fields.py; proximity around labels; dateparser; rapidfuzz vendor; confidence + method fields.\nDoD: higher fill rate; low-confidence flagged."",enhancement;roadmap,""Sprint 2"""
"Phase 5: Line Items & Totals,""Goal: extract tables and reconcile totals.\nTasks: table detection (lines/Y-bins); parse qty/unit/amount; sum vs total; vendor opt-in.\nDoD: items JSON + status for enabled vendors."",enhancement;roadmap,""Sprint 3"""
"Phase 6: Output & Reporting Polish,""Goal: business-friendly outputs.\nTasks: stable column order; Excel hyperlinks; mgmt XLSX+PDF; combined vendor PDFs; hardened SharePoint.\nDoD: one command produces all artifacts."",enhancement;roadmap,""Sprint 3"""
"Phase 7: Scale & Performance,""Goal: throughput and telemetry.\nTasks: ProcessPoolExecutor with chunks; producer/consumer; DPI tuning; perf log P95/RSS.\nDoD: 2–3× throughput; perf CSV present."",enhancement;roadmap,""Sprint 4"""
"Phase 8: Observability & Failures,""Goal: fast debugging, explicit exceptions.\nTasks: JSON logs with run_id; exception CSVs; metrics.json.\nDoD: unified run folder enables quick triage."",enhancement;roadmap,""Sprint 4"""
"Phase 9: Tests & CI,""Goal: regression safety.\nTasks: unit tests for preprocess/extract/filename; golden tests; GH Actions lint+type+test.\nDoD: CI green; coverage on critical paths."",enhancement;roadmap,""Sprint 5"""
"Phase 10: Packaging, CLI & Docker,""Goal: easy installs and reproducible runs.\nTasks: console scripts; Dockerfile with Tesseract+Poppler; versioning + changelog.\nDoD: pipx and docker paths both work."",enhancement;roadmap,""Sprint 5"""
